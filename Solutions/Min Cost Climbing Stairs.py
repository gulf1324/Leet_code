"""
DP ==> recurrence
cost[i] += min(cost[i-1], cost[i-2]) is a recurrence in disguise: 
it says the cost to reach step i depends on the minimum of the costs to reach the two previous steps, 
plus the cost at [i]. It's a rule that repeats, connecting each step to the ones before it. 
Whether you're coding it recursively or iteratively, 
that recurring pattern is what makes DP tickâ€”turning a messy, exponential problem into something linear by reusing past results.
