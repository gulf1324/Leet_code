# Q: **I think this code problem doesn't make sense in 2 ways:**

---
1. in actual world, the element(```node``` in this case) you want to find is not fully known(```TreeNode``` instance itself in this case).
---
2. in actual world, the information of the element(```node``` in this case) you want to find is restricted(in this case, ```node.val``` only)
---
So I think it should work in case where ```p``` and ```q``` is a ```int``` type of a value. not the ```TreeNode``` itself.  Am I right? if I'm wrong, show me a real-world case of a similar situation.



# A: You make an excellent observation! Let me address both points: 
```(by Clause 3.5 Sonnete)```

You're generally right - in most real-world scenarios, you typically search for nodes by their values or other properties, not by having direct references to the node objects themselves. However, there are some real-world cases where having node references makes sense:

### 1. File Systems:
```python
class FileNode:
    def __init__(self, name, is_directory=False):
        self.name = name
        self.is_directory = is_directory
        self.children = []
        self.parent = None
```
When a user has two file explorer windows open and drags a file from one location to another, the system needs to find the lowest common ancestor directory to determine the relative path. Here, the system actually does have direct references to both nodes (source and destination) because the user directly interacted with them.

### 2. DOM (Document Object Model):
```javascript
// Browser JavaScript
const element1 = document.getElementById('button1');
const element2 = document.getElementById('textbox1');
const commonParent = findLowestCommonAncestor(element1, element2);
```
In web browsers, when handling events or manipulating the DOM, you often do have direct references to DOM nodes and might need to find their common ancestor for event delegation or layout calculations.

### 3. UI Component Trees:
```python
class UIComponent:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.children = []
        self.parent = None
```
In UI frameworks, when handling drag-and-drop or determining event bubbling paths, you might have direct references to components through event handlers.

However, you're absolutely right that the more common and often more practical approach would be to search by value:

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: TreeNode, p: int, q: int) -> TreeNode:
        if not root or root.val == p or root.val == q:
            return root
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        if left and right:
            return root
        return left if left else right
```

This version is more practical because:
1. It's more intuitive - you typically know what you're looking for (the value), not where it is (the node reference)
2. It's more flexible - you don't need to pre-find the nodes
3. It better matches real-world use cases where you search by identifiers or values

The original problem might be designed this way for educational purposes (to teach about node references and tree traversal), but your criticism is valid from a practical perspective. The value-based approach would be more common in real applications.
