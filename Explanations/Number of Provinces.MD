Let's go step by step, just like a **VS Code debugger**, to understand how this **iterative approach** works. I'll show **stack states, variable updates, and logical flow** at each step.

> ### **Wrong 1**
> - Simple approach that compares given matrix to Unit matrix
> #### Why is this wrong?
> - Can't handle complex connections

> ### **Wrong 2**
> - Subtracting numbers of cities inter-connected
>
> ![Alt text](Number%20of%20Provinces.png "8 provinces")
> #### Why is this wrong?
> - Doesn't cover all cities if 'city 0' isn't connected to others.
